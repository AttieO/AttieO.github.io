<p>
 When I get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself,
 I want to go to a land that’s far away. I want to go to a faraway island.
 I want to go to an island that has no people.
 I want to go to an island that has no pain or sadness.
 On that island, I can climb a tree when I want to climb,
 swim in the sea when I want to swim, and sleep when I want to sleep.
 When I think about the town without me, I feel a sense of relief.I want to go far, far away.
