<h3><font color="Red">The country? The skies? You can have them.
I’m busy just protecting what’s right in front of me.
I don’t know what’ll happen to me in the future, but if something has fallen at my feet, then the least I can do is pick it up.

<h3><font color="Orange">When I get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself, I want to go to a land that’s far away.
I want to go to a faraway island. I want to go to an island that has no people. I want to go to an island that has no pain or sadness.
There are no adults, children, classmates, teachers or my mom on that island.
On that island, I can climb a tree when I want to climb, swim in the see when I want to swim, and sleep when I want to sleep.
In the island, I think about the town that I left behind. Kids go to school, as if nothing has changed.
Adults go to the office, as if nothing has changed. Mom eats, as if nothing has changed.
When I think about the town without me, I feel a sense of relief. I want to go far, far away</font></h3>
