<h3><font color="White">When I get bigger, big enough to go somewhere by myself, I want to go to a land that's far away.
I want to go to a faraway island. I want to go to an island that has no people. I want to go to an island that has no pain or sadness.
There are no adults, children, classmates, teachers or my mom on that island.
On that island, I can climb a tree when I want to climb, swim in the see when I want to swim, and sleep when I want to sleep.
In the island, I think about the town that I left behind. Kids go to school, as if nothing has changed.
Adults go to the office, as if nothing has changed. Mom eats, as if nothing has changed.
When I think about the town without me, I feel a sense of relief. I want to go far, far away.</font></h3>
</nav3>
<nav2>
<h3><font color="Pink">When do you think people die?
When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No.
When they are ravaged by an incurable disease? No.
When they drink a soup made from a poisonous mushroom!?
No! It's when they are forgotten.</font></h3>
</nav2>
<nav>
<h3><font color="Yellow">The country? The skies? You can have them.
I'm busy just protecting what's right in front of me.
I don't know what'll happen to me in the future, but if something has fallen at my feet, then the least I can do is pick it up.
</font></h3>
</nav>
<nav4>
<h3><font color="Black">I may not be as clever now that I lost my talent to study,
I need things explained to me hundred times more than normal people do.
But that only means I have to study a hundred times more than everyone else.
Not having any talents just means you have to work harder, that's all.</font></h3>
</nav4>
<nav3>
<h3><font color="Blue">It's almost unbearable, isn't it… the pain of being all alone.
I know that feeling, I've been there, in that dark and lonely place, but now there are others, other people who mean a lot to me.
I care more about them than I do myself, and I won't let anyone hurt them.
That's why I'll never give up, I will stop you, even if I have to kill you!
They saved me from myself, they rescued me from my loneliness, they were the first to accept me as who I am.</font></h3>
</nav3>
<nav5>
<h3><font color="Grey">Once in a while when I wake up, I find myself crying.
The dream I must've had I can never recall.
But… the sensation that I've lost something,
lingers for a long time after I wake up.</font></h3>
</nav5>
<nav6>
<h3><font color="red">A lump of steel, like a shooting star.
Just seeing the same sky as you makes familiar scenery look different.
I swing between hope and despair at your slightest gesture, and my heart starts to play a melody.
What kind of feeling is this again? What do they call this kind of feeling? I think it's probably called..Love.
I'm sure this is what they call love.</font></h3>
